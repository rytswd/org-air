;;; org-air-known-failures.el --- expected-failure manifest for org-air -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Single source of truth for tests that are EXPECTED to fail right now
;; (grind signals for the impl track).  `make test' loads this file after
;; all test suites and calls `org-air-test-apply-known-failures', which
;; marks every listed test with an expected result of :failed.
;;
;; Effect on orchestration: the suite is binary.
;;   - a listed test failing      -> expected   (exit 0)
;;   - a listed test PASSING      -> unexpected (exit 1) — remove it here!
;;   - an unlisted test failing   -> unexpected (exit 1)
;; So `make test' exit code is the single integration gate, and a stale
;; manifest entry is itself a failure, keeping this list honest.
;;
;; Workflow: when writing a spec-true test the impl does not satisfy yet,
;; add its symbol here with a short reason.  When impl fixes it, the run
;; goes red until the entry is deleted — that deletion is the closeout.

    ;; landed on trunk3 (pwuqtvlt) and all 5 regression tests pass.
    ;; 2026-06-12: the entire 17-entry v0.2 grind manifest closed out on
    ;; the integrated main line (wzmskzwn) — 16 entries verified
    ;; passed-unexpectedly through the anti-tautology render guards
    ;; (real renderer produced the bytes: width seam, 80/120/160
    ;; composition, byte-precise §3 mockups, divider geometry,
    ;; persistent calendar, empty-board shape, summary integrity, rail
    ;; faces, TTY fallback); the 17th, org-air-viewport-no-trailing-
    ;; whitespace, was RETIRED with its test as §9.1-obsolete: spec rev
    ;; orwonzvz makes plain-space padding to full width the contract
    ;; (comparison is right-trimmed), so trailing whitespace is mandated
    ;; — drift protection now lives in the exact-width assertions and
    ;; the byte-precise mockup comparison.
    ;; 2026-06-12: all 3 F1/F2a/F3 data-variation entries closed out —
    ;; impl2's de-hardcoding (svknxvow) verified honest on both boards
    ;; (calendar = true data union, no TTY glyph leaks).  Note: the
    ;; fidelity review's hand-derived original-fixture union missed the
    ;; real Jun 19 deadline; the test now parses ground truth from the
    ;; fixture files directly.
    ;; 2026-06-13: mockup-80/120/160 closed out — fixtures regenerated
    ;; ONCE from the honest D1-D7 renderer (ymvlyvuk) via make
    ;; regen-mockups (guards active), plus the new threshold set
