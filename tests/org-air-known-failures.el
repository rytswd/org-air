;;; org-air-known-failures.el --- expected-failure manifest for org-air -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:
;; Single source of truth for tests that are EXPECTED to fail right now
;; (grind signals for the impl track).  `make test' loads this file after
;; all test suites and calls `org-air-test-apply-known-failures', which
;; marks every listed test with an expected result of :failed.
;;
;; Effect on orchestration: the suite is binary.
;;   - a listed test failing      -> expected   (exit 0)
;;   - a listed test PASSING      -> unexpected (exit 1) — remove it here!
;;   - an unlisted test failing   -> unexpected (exit 1)
;; So `make test' exit code is the single integration gate, and a stale
;; manifest entry is itself a failure, keeping this list honest.
;;
;; Workflow: when writing a spec-true test the impl does not satisfy yet,
;; add its symbol here with a short reason.  When impl fixes it, the run
;; goes red until the entry is deleted — that deletion is the closeout.
